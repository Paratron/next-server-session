# next-server-session
Functions to handle serverside session data and csrf tokens for nextJS 10.x

They can be used both in `getServerSideProps` as well as in API routes.

## Motivation
I wanted to build a project that uses serverside sessions to store auth data. I disliked the APIs of existing packages,
so I wrote my own.
